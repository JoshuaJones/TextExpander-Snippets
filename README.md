# TextExpander Snippets

Collection of my TextExpander snippets used for daily coding and what-not.

## Snippet Groups

#### Characters

Set of characters or silly emoticons. Inspired from Brett Terpstra's with a few of my own thrown in. 

Personal favorite being: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

#### HTML

Snippets for basic markup. Like the CSS group, not commonly used while working in Sublime or other IDEs, but useful nonetheless.

#### HTML Type Entities

Collection of HTML entities for correctly rendering out quotation, math symbols and more.

#### CSS

Set of snippets for common css properties including properties needing prefixes. Typically SASS+Compass handles a lot of this, but on projects where that's not an option I turn to these trusty shortcuts.

#### SASS

I typically always use the same sort of structure on SASS projects. These are my "go-to" snippets for quickly setting up a mixin.scss or variables.scss file within said projects.

#### JavaScript

Simple patterns and snippets used in everyday js development. Basic object template, self-invoking anon function, jQuery doc ready and the wide range of console.log uses included.

#### Filesystem

Shortcuts for moving around the system while working within the Terminal.

#### Markdown

I write a lot of stuff with Markdown. This makes it faster to do and also works when writing on the iPad.

#### Utilities

Basic shortcuts for things like spitting out times and dates, fetching my internal or external IP, quick use of xip.io and other server related snippets.
